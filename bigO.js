// Q: Suppose we want to write a function that calculates the sum of all numbers
// from 1 up to (and including) some number n. 
// If you came up with these two solutions below, you're going to think about which one is better? 


// <-- solution 1 -->

function addUpTo(n) {
    total = 0;
    for (let i = 1; i <= n; i++) {
        total += i;
    }
    return total;
}

console.log(addUpTo(7));


// <-- solution 2 -->
function addUpTo(n) {
    return n * (n + 1) / 2;
}
console.log(addUpTo(6));


// what dose better mean before decided it? 
// 1. faster? -speed
// 2. less memory-intensive? -space
// 3. more readable, legible? - readability 
// among them SPEED, SPACE are important. 
// Let's focus on evaluating Speed.
